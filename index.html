            <p> My favourite hobby is coding. You know why? I love it because when I dreamt about becoming FAMOUS, one fine day my father said to join CODING through www.whitehatjr.com. We didn't knew its famous but just joined it. On the day of the trial class, the teacher who just gave the demo, was so kind in explaining the things. She is now my coding teacher since AUGUST 2020. She is the best, loving and kindest teacher I have ever got. Making websites and developing apps is the most favourite things of mine...The teacher appriciate me now and everytime I have the class or the project. One day, I will become famous by coding and I will be so happy after becoming famous...Lovely dream....After reading all this, you will know about this famous quote : "If you can dream it, you can achieve it. </p>
